        <h1>Change in QI Process</h1>
        Before beginning a QI project at Norton Healthcare, there is a two step process:
          <ol>
            <li>Either IRB approval or a determination that IRB submission is not needed</li>
            <li>Facilities approval by Norton Healthcare (which may include several steps)</li>
          </ol>
        To ensure that your project is able to move through these steps as efficiently as possible, NCRI has recently changed its process for QI projects. Now all you need to do is submit your project to NCRI at
        <a href="http://helpmencri.org/help">http://helpmencri.org/help</a>. Our team will determine whether your project needs IRB approval, and if so get it submitted to the IRB. We will also make sure your projects gets facilities approval from Norton Healthcare.

        <h2>Other Timelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting a 1st or 2nd year UofL medical student access to Epic: <strong><nobr>6 weeks</nobr></strong>
          <p><i>This timeline can vary depending on how long it takes the student to return paper work. Also, this timeline only applies to UofL medical students (there are challenges with other kinds of students) and only for projects that do not require students to work in Norton facilities.</i></p></li>
