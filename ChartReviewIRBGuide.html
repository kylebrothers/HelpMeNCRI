        <h1>Change in Retrospective Chart Review Process</h1>
        In the past, NCRI had encouranged investigators to submit their own retrospective chart review protocols to the IRB. However, we have recently recognized that this tends to create more problems than it fixes.
        So we now recommend you submit your protocol to NCRI at <a href="http://helpmencri.org/help">http://helpmencri.org/help</a>. Our team will get it submitted to the IRB for you, and will make sure it gets all
        of the appropriate Norton facilities approval.
